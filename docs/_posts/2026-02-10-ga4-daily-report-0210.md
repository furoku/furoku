**PV 8,652. Sessions 2,782. Both all-time highs.**

Monday's V-shaped recovery fully offset Saturday's dip. The hypothesis that the user base is primarily business users was validated by the data.

## Traffic Summary (02/09 data, provisional)

| Metric | Value | Day-over-Day |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| PV | 8,652 | **+45%** |
| Sessions | 2,782 | **+38%** |
| Avg. Session Duration | 5m 52s | — |
| Engagement Rate | 59.1% | — |

A 5m 52s session duration indicates users are actively reading and testing prompts — not drive-by traffic.

## Daily Trend — Saturday Dip → Monday Record Pattern

| Date | PV | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| 02/06 (Thu) | 5,052 | ⚡ Spike begins |
| 02/07 (Fri) | 7,860 | ⚡⚡ Previous PV peak |
| 02/08 (Sat) | 5,986 | Saturday decay |
| 02/09 (Mon) | 8,652 | ⚡⚡⚡ **Monday V-recovery, new ATH** |

A clear pattern: **weekday growth, weekend dip, new weekly high on Monday.** This signals business-use dominance — users referencing the prompt pattern collection for NotebookLM in professional contexts.

## Top 5 Pages

| Page | PV | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| infographic-evaluation /ko/ | 2,598 | 🇰🇷 Korean edition #1 |
| infographic-evaluation / | 2,095 | Japanese top |
| infographic-evaluation /index.html | 2,074 | Japanese (alt URL) |
| infographic-olympic | 458 | Olympic special |
| infographic-evaluation /zh/ | 417 | 🇹🇼 Chinese edition |

Korean edition surpassed the Japanese edition. Significant finding.

## Top 5 Traffic Sources

| Source | Sessions | Share |
|--------|----------|-------|
| (direct) | 1,698 | 61% |
| BananaNL referral | 509 | 18% |
| X/Twitter | 159 | 6% |
| Google Search | 135 | 5% |
| note.com | 45 | — |

BananaNL at 18% has stabilized. The Chrome Extension → Website traffic path is established — a proprietary distribution channel independent of Google's algorithm. For analytics practitioners, owning a distribution channel is highly valuable.

## Country Analysis

| Country | Share | Notable |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 🇯🇵 Japan | 63% | Base |
| 🇰🇷 Korea | 26% | **Pages/session: 4.23** |
| 🇹🇼 Taiwan | 8% | Chinese edition driving |

Korean users' 4.23 pages/session is exceptional — viewing 4+ pages per session, likely comparing and evaluating prompts. Either translation quality is strong, Korean NotebookLM demand is high, or both.

## Self-Improvement Loop — Style Rankings

The AI agent analyzes GA4 data each morning to update prompt style popularity rankings.

### Top 3

| Rank | Style | Score |
|------|-------|-------|
| 🥇 | Memphis | 619 |
| 🥈 | Doodle | 587 |
| 🥉 | Isometric | 469 |

### Trending Styles

| Style | Movement | Growth |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Clay/Stopmotion | 9→8 | **+14%** |
| Manga/Shoujo | 11→10 | **+14%** |
| Neon/Black | 15→13 | **+13%** |

Growth in "cute" styles (Clay, Manga) suggests expansion beyond business use into creative applications.

### Today's Recommendation: Marble/White/Gold

Placing an underperforming style near the top to gauge user response — an "exploration" phase. A multi-armed bandit approach to discover hidden strong styles.

## Weekly Summary (02/03–02/09)

The most impressive numbers:

| Metric | This Week | Week-over-Week |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| bananaX total | **35,794 PV** | **12x** |
| 🇰🇷 Korean edition | 10→**10,527 PV** | **~1,000x** |
| 🇹🇼 Chinese edition | 19→**1,214 PV** | **64x** |
| 🇬🇧 English edition | 44→**1,814 PV** | **41x** |

Korean edition going from 10 to 10,527 PV represents a multilingual expansion from near-zero to explosive growth in one week. The prior week's 10 PV was the initial value right after translation launch.

## Insights

1. **Saturday dip → Monday ATH = business user base.** Time content and campaigns for weekdays.
2. **BananaNL at 18% stable → Chrome extension traffic path established.** Proprietary distribution channels are a strategic advantage.
3. **Cute styles (Clay, Manga) at +14% growth.** Demand spans both business and creative use cases.
4. **Korean edition surpassed Japanese edition.** Multilingual support isn't "nice to have" — it's essential.
